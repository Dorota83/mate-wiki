MATE is a fork of the now unmaintained [GNOME 2](https://www.gnome.org).
MATE provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

MATE is under active development to add support for new technologies while preserving a traditional desktop experience. MATE also supports running the environment without compositing, making MATE a suitable choice for lower-end hardware.
